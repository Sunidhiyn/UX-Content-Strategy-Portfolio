# Case Study: UX Writing for Secure SSO Onboarding (SAML)

## Summary
At my company, I led the UX content strategy for SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) onboarding. The goal was to improve user trust, comprehension, and activation rate for enterprise clients adopting AI-powered access control.

I collaborated with product managers, designers, and engineers to create onboarding flows, microcopy, and troubleshooting guidance that demystified a complex, security-heavy process.
