# Before/After: Clarity & Accessibility in Error Messaging

## Challenge

Pathlock's older error messages were:
- Vague ("Something went wrong")
- Not actionable
- Lacked accessibility support

## Example

**Before**: "Invalid user action"  
**After**: "You donâ€™t have permission to perform this action. Contact your administrator."
