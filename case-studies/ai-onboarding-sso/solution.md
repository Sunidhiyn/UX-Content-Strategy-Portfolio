## The Solution

I implemented a structured, layered content experience:

- **Humanized microcopy**: Translated jargon into clear, benefit-led steps
- **Chatbot flows**: Wrote natural-language troubleshooting conversations
- **Step-wise UI copy**: Broke down each configuration step with user-focused micro-tasks
- **Added error recovery**: Included "What you can do next" fallback paths
- **Visual aids**: Designed simplified diagrams for enterprise admins

I also documented this as a repeatable template for other authentication workflows.
